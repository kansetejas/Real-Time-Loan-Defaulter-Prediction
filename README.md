The capacity to anticipate loan defaults in real-time is essential for risk mitigation and maintaining the stability of banking institutions in the quickly changing financial landscape of today. With the help of cutting-edge machine learning algorithms and data visualization technologies, this project, "Real-Time Loan Default Prediction and Visualization Using Machine Learning, Streamlit, and Azure Blob Storage," seeks to provide banks with a reliable and easy-to-use method for quickly and accurately identifying potential defaulters.

The first step of the project is to create a solid machine learning model that can forecast loan defaults using a range of demographic and financial variables. The model will be trained on past loan data using sophisticated algorithms like Random Forest, Gradient Boosting, and Neural Networks to find trends and warning signs of default risk. To achieve high predicted accuracy, the right feature selection and model parameter adjustment would be essential.

We will use Streamlit, an open-source Python framework that makes it possible to quickly construct interactive web applications, to enable real-time prediction. Bank officials and other stakeholders can enter pertinent customer data using a Streamlit-based interface and get instant feedback on the probability of a loan default.
